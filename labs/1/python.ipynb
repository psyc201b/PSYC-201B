    "## Computational Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We will primarily be using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to interface with Python. Confusingly, a jupyter notebook is simply a file that ends with `.ipynb` and has nothing to do with whether you are using *JupyterLab* or *VSCode* as your coding environment. Both programs can read/edit notebook files!\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook consists of **cells** that demarcate blocks of text or code. The two main types of cells you will use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **_code cell_**: contains actual code that you want to run. You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar in your Jupyter notebook (or command palette in VSCode). Otherwise, you can can hit esc and then y (denoted \"esc, y\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell. Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it.\n",
    "If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit \"shift + enter.\" Note that code cells are executed in the order you execute them. That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit \"shift + enter\" is the order in which the code is executed. If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are not known to the Python interpreter!\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **_markdown cells_** contain text. The text is written in markdown, a lightweight markup language. You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and use it format your text (e.g. bold, italics) or embed images and links. Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly. As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text. Hitting \"shift + enter\" renders the text in the formatting you specify.  You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar, or by hitting \"esc, m\" in the cell. Again, you have to hit enter after using the quick keys to bring the cell into edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two ways of working with cells or their contents are known as \"command mode\" and \"edit mode\" respectively. Both modes have different [keyboard shortcuts](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/jupyterlab/keyboardshortcuts.html) that can be helpful as you gain more experience."

    "### Variables\n",
    "A _variable_ is a named object-- i.e. a thing that Python knows has a particular value.  It's often useful to write code that incorporates named variables wherever possible (rather than hard-coding in specific numerical values).  This way of abstracting way the specific values from the set of operations you want to perform on those values allows you to use the same line of code to perform different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a variable, you use the _assignment_ operator, `=`.  The name of your variable goes on the left side of the assignment operator, and the value you want to assign to that variable goes on the right side.  Play around with the example below to see how it works.  For example, change the values of `x` and `y` and see how the answers change."

    "  - **Boolean** (`bool`): `True` or `False`.\n",
