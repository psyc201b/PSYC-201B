```{admonition} HW 1
Available: **Wed, Jan 15** (after class)  
Due: **Mon, Jan 20** (before class)
```

```{important}
*Starting from this week we'll be using Github Classroom to provide class & lab materials (e.g. jupyter notebook files, datasets, etc).*  

*Any links below that include ðŸ“š, will take you to a github classroom assignment that you should accept and clone to your local computer. You can use these local files to follow-along in lecture, lab, or to work on HW assignments.* 

*We've recorded a tutorial video you can find linked in the course navigation to the left, under Computing Resources > [Using Github Classroom](/pages/github_classroom.md) in-case you get confused!*
