# Overview
```{admonition} HW 1
Available: **Wed, Jan 15** (after class)  
Due: **Tues, Jan 21** (before lab)
```

```{important}
*Starting from this week we'll be using Github Classroom to provide class & lab materials (e.g. jupyter notebook files, datasets, etc).*  

*Any links below that include ðŸ“š, will take you to a github classroom assignment that you should accept and clone to your local computer. You can use these local files to follow-along in lecture, lab, or to work on HW assignments.* 

*We've summarized the steps and recorded a tutorial video on the [Assignments (Github Classroom)](/pages/github_classroom.md) page in-case you get confused!*
