    "Your first attempt at writing a computer program will contain errors (bugs).  It's not about you, this is true for everyone, including your instructors and professional programmers. Learning to program is actually just as much about **reading and fix errors in code** as it is about writing new code from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with tools like Generative AI, **understanding what gives rise to errors and how to handle them** will help you **learn Python much faster**. This process is called \"debugging\". Here we provide some accumulated wisdom about debugging. Fortunately, the steps to fixing the bug yourself, searching the internet for help, or asking someone (or GenAI) for help are the same.  "

    "\n",
    "- **Code does not execute**: These bugs will yield some kind message from the Python interpreter describing the error with a key word of the form ***SomeError*** (e.g., `ValueError`, `SyntaxError`, `IndentationError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.). These errors may be further divided into:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Syntax errors**, which arise when the interpreter does not know how to parse the code you have written (e.g., failure to close parentheses, or quotes, incorrect indentation, missing colon, missing comma, etc.).  Python indicates that an error has occurred in its attempt to parse the code, and points out where it *thinks* the error occurred.  However, since Python could not parse your code, it might be incorrect in identifying the location of the error.     \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Runtime exceptions**, which arise when the interpreter can parse the code you have written, but cannot do something you have told it to do (e.g., add a string and an integer, divide by 0, refer to a non-existant index/key/variable/method)     \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code executes, but does the wrong thing**: These bugs will not yield any kind of error message -- the program will execute without the computer thinking that anything is amiss, but the program will do something other than what you intended.  These kinds of bugs are much harder to diagnose and fix!  When trying to fix these sorts of bugs try to figure out: did you tell the computer what to do incorrectly?  or did you tell it to do the wrong thing? \n"
