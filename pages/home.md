## About
As computers have become increasingly powerful,  modern statistical practice has changed [cite stat society paper], and we live in an era of endless excitement for  machine-learning and artificial intelligence.  And yet, at the heart of the vast majority statistical analyses are just a handful of key ideas. This course is designed to help you appreciate these ideas by developing your own statistical intuitions. We’ll do this by taking a look at the same basic ideas through multiple lenses: *algebraic* (“math-y”), *geometric* (“visual”), and *algorithmic* (“hacker”).  At the core of the class is a deep understanding of the **General-Linear-Model (GLM)** from which we’ll connect to additional  concepts. We’ll also translate between similar ideas in statistics and machine-learning, while appreciating their “cultural” differences. The core focus of this class is to provide you with a useful framework for computational thinking about analysis and inference, rather than “ritualizing” what types of statistical routines are “correct” for what types of data. This should help you lay a foundation from which you can confidently pursue more advanced topics such as advanced machine/deep-learning, deep-learning, bayesian statistics, and advanced econometrics.  
**Requirements**: [PSYC 201A](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/58741) or equivalent  
**Note**: this course will be taught in the *Python*, but experience in another language (e.g. R, Matlab) is sufficient
