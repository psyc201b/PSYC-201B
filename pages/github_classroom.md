# Using Github Classroom

We'll be using Github Classroom to share all resources for class. This will allow you to retrieve and work on class, lab, and HW notebooks on your local computer **without having to click the download** button from the website. 

  ## Quick steps

  1. Open any course link that starts with ðŸ“š 
  2. Accept the assignment in your browser
  3. Click the URL to go the auto-created github repo (this will alway be named `assignment-name-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME`)
  4. Clone it to your local computer using `git clone`
  5. Open and work on any notebook files using JupyterLab or VSCode
  6. Commit your changes locally using `git add` & `git commit`
  7. Push your changes to github using `git push`
  8. Respond to any feedback discussions under the "Pull Requests" tab on the github repo
