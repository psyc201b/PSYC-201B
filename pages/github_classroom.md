# Assignments (Github Classroom)

We'll be using Github Classroom to share all resources for class. **This is the primary way you should be downloading and working with course materials**. Each week, we'll create a new Github Classroom assignment link (prefixed with ðŸ“š). Clicking it will automatically create a github repository for you containing all the materials you need. 

You'll then be able to clone this repository to your computer, working through files interactively, make edits/updates, and commit and submit your assignment for review. Each time you push your work to Github, your instructors will be able to provide review, feedback, and discussions that directly reference your code.

```{tip}
You'll *always* be able to access your assignment repositories, history, and instructor feedback after the course is over. So the more effort you put into assignments, the more you engage with instructors, the more you'll learn, and the higher quality resources you'll have for your own future reference!
```

  ## Quick steps

  1. Open any course link that starts with ðŸ“š 
  2. Accept the assignment in your browser
  3. Click the URL to go the auto-created github repo (this will alway be named `assignment-name-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME`)
  4. Clone it to your local computer using `git clone`
  5. Open and work on any notebook files using JupyterLab or VSCode
  6. Commit your changes locally using `git add` & `git commit`
  7. Push your changes to github using `git push`
  8. Respond to any feedback discussions under the "Pull Requests" tab on the github repo
