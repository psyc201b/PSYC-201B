## Class Format
This course will primarily consist of: (a) lectures/discussions; (b) interactive lab sessions; (c)weekly problem-sets; (d) a take-home midterm and final project. 

### Lectures
Lecture topics are approximately organized by week as indicated on the left sidebar, but there will be some overlap between weeks when we need to spend more time on a topic. During scheduled lectures we'll be using a combination of slides, diagrams, and jupyter notebooks. I'll aim to make these materials available on this course website ahead of an upcoming class. After class, I'll plan to post any slide updates, a screen-recording from my computer, along with audio from the lecture/discussion. You don't need to look at slides ahead of class, but you **should be doing the readings** and be **prepared to participate in class discussions**.

### Labs
Lab sessions will be built upon the concepts taught in lectures with a focus on hands-on computing with Python. Previous Python experience is *not required*, but prior programming experience in another langauge (e.g. R, Matlab) is helpful. We'll start slow and provide plently of resources, links, and additional tutorials on the course website. Labs will also familiarize you with the tools you'll be using to complete and submit assignments (i.e. jupyter notebooks, github, etc). 

### Homework Problem-sets
Approximately every week, you'll receive a problem-set of questions covering that week's topics. Problem-sets will always be due the **Sunday before class at midnight PST**. You should complete and submit problems using the provided jupyter notebook template, containing both code and prose that answers the questions. **You are permitted to work on weekly assignments with other students**. However, you should list the names of all students you worked with.

### Midterm & Final
The midterm will be a take-home exam that will consist of questions similar to the weekly problem-sets, **however you must complete the midterm by yourself**. You have a choice of options for the final including:
- a novel analysis of your own/your lab's data or a publicly available open dataset
- paired problem-set generation, where you and another student will generate and score problem sets for each other
- instructor provided final analysis project

More details about the final will be provided later in the term and on this course website.

## Class Resources

### Communication
We will primarily be communicating using the course [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/psyc201b/shared_invite/zt-2wld531n4-tGqypNfqkftXdWZZ5vzoyA) so please make sure you join by the end of Week 1 or let your instructors know if you have any issues!

### Reading Materials
This website and linked materials will serve as the *primary digitial textbook* for the course. Readings for each week can be found on the [readings page](/pages/readings). We will be leaning heavily on readings from the following textbooks in addition to various assigned articles:
1. [Statistical Thinkings for the 21st Century](https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/index.html) by Russ Poldrack
2. [Elements of Statistical Learning](/pdfs/ESL.pdf) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman
3. [Statistical Methods for Behavioral and Social Sciences (labs)](https://psych252.github.io/psych252book/) by Tobias Gestenberg
4. [Regression and other stories](/pdfs/ROS.pdf) by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari
5. [The Truth about Linear Regression](/pdfs/TALR.pdf) by Cosma Rohilla Shalizi

### Computing Resources
Each student will have access to a [UCSD provided Jupyterhub instance](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F) that includes pre-installed versions of all Python packages and configurations necessary to complete the course. You should be able to access this instance by the end of Week 1 and from anywhere you can VPN into UCSD.

Alternatively, your instructors can help you configure your own personal computer using the same Python packages and configurations. This option is ideal for students who have a preferred coding setup (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), have access to more advanced resources, or simply want to learn more about the scientific Python ecosystem.

### Technical References
Under the *Computing Resources* section, we will provide or link to various reference materials, tutorials, notebooks, and guides covering ancillary technical topics and hurdles you may encounter. These include a variety of introductory tutorials, [cheatsheets](/pages/cheatsheets), and with a [glossary of terminology](/resources/glossary) to help you navigate the scientific Python ecosystem.

## Grading
- 30% - *Class participation*: attending, reading, and participating in class discussions & labs
- 20% - *Weekly problem-sets*: ~10 total, ~2% each, completed alone or with peers
- 20% - *Midterm problem-set*: completed alone
- 30% - *Final project*: choose your option 

**Mastery based grading.** We’re interested in grading you on your ability to achieve the skill sets that are taught in this course. You’re allowed to resubmit problem sets for re-grading if you feel like you could do better. Your final grade will replace your initial grade.

**Cooperative extra-credit.** When working with other students on problem-sets, you have the opportunity to earn extra-credit. Working collaboratively with others is not sufficient for extra-credit. You can only submit a consideration for extra-credit if you and/or your peers feel like you went *above-and-beyond* on a given weekly problem-set. To do so, include a note in your jupyter notebook, indicating either: (a) who you helped, how, and what they learned; OR (b) who helped you, how, and what you learned. Extra credit can contribute up to 10% of your final grade.

## Academic Integrity
All students are expected to adhere to standards of academic integrity. Cheating of any kind on any assignment will not be tolerated. It is disrespectful to your peers, the university, and to me. If you are unsure what might constitute a violation of academic integrity, consult the instructor and/or the UCSD website on academic integrity: [http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu.). Any evidence of academic misconduct will be reported to the Academic Integrity Office.

## Generative AI Course Policy
*Adapted from the UC San Diego & University of Waterloo Academic Integrity Offices*  

```{warning}
*GenAI is known to fabricate sources, facts, and give false information. It also perpetuates bias. You should also be aware that there are copyright and privacy concerns with these tools. You should exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources for these reasons. Also, you are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.* 
```

We encourage the use of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools like [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Anthropic's Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Github's Co-pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), or [Google's Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) to help you master concepts and skills in this class in accordance with the [UCSD Academic Integrity Guidelines on GenAI](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/excel-integrity/gen-ai/ai-in-education.html) and the following guidelines:

1. If you use GenAI for any submitted coursework, you **must attach a link or text transcript** to any assignments you submit. Many services offer a "share your chat" link-creation function or you can use a Google Chrome Browser Extension like [ChatGPT Exporter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-exporter-extract/ilmdofdhpnhffldihboadndccenlnfll?hl=en) or [Claude Exporter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude-exporter-extract-c/elhmfakncmnghlnabnolalcjkdpfjnin). This will help us provide feedback on using LLM tools effectively (if desired) and make it transparent to us how you are completing assignments, while respecting the standards of academic integrity.
2. Directly prompting GenAI with course assignments, or copying/pasting GenAI output instead of performing the work yourself, **will not earn you assignment credit** and **could result in an academic integrity violation**. 

Instead you should aim to **master GenAI as tools** that supplement your programming and critical thinking skills, not as a substitute for them. They can be especially helpful for: debugging and troubleshooting unfamiliar code, reviewing Python fundamentals, reasoning about statistical concepts via analogy/example, or simply conversing in natural language about technical concepts. 

## Absence policy
Family emergencies and illness are excused absences, as per UCSD policy. Please do not come to class if you have active symptoms (instead, please rest!). In general, absences will have a direct impact on your ability to learn the skills presented in this course as well as your participation grade.  However, you do have opportunity to make up some grade points via extra-credit (see above).

**Life happens**. That being said, I really care about you, and your well-being. I know that life happens, and that sometimes you simply can’t be in class or turn in an assignment on time. There may also be times when I am unable to make it to class for a given reason, and I will ask for your grace and understanding then as well.  Please, prioritize your well-being in graduate school and use this class as a way for you to learn skills that will be useful for your career (versus focusing on passing the requirements on the class). 

## OSD Accommodations
Any student with a documented disability will be accommodated according to University policy. For details, please consult the Office of Students with Disabilities (OSD): [http://disabilities.ucsd.edu](http://disabilities.ucsd.edu). If you require accommodation for any component of the course, please provide the instructor with documentation from OSD as soon as possible. Please note that accommodations cannot be made retroactively under any circumstances.
