# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! Thanks for checking out this sample book. I've put together this friendly guide to show you how cool Jupyter Books can be and how they organize different types of content.

Inside, you'll find some fun examples of the main file types you can use, along with sample content to play around with. While this is just a quick tour (think of it as a tasty appetizer ðŸ˜‹), it should give you a good feel for what's possible!

Want to dive deeper? No problem! Head over to [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) where you'll find tons of detailed information and cool features to explore.

Happy learning! ðŸ“šâœ¨
